# code4hope
Code 4 Hope is fiscally sponsored by The Hack Foundation (d.b.a. Hack Club), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. We host hackathons every 2-3 months on various topics and categories for charitable organizations. Our hackathons aim to allow students with a passion for coding and any level of experience to show their skills and contribute to innovation while making an impact.
